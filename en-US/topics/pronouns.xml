	<title> Pronouns </title>
	 <para>
		Pronouns are pointers to a noun. These are some common singular pronouns:
	</para>
	 <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				you
			</para>

		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				it
			</para>

		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				this
			</para>

		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				that
			</para>

		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 <para>
		These are some common plural pronouns:

			<para>

		</listitem>
		 <listitem>
			<para>
				those
			</para>

		</listitem>

	</itemizedlist>
	 <para>
		In technical writing, pronouns are simplified because English doesn't assign gender to inorganic things.
	</para>
	 <note>
		<para>
			If you are writing a use case and need to reference a fictional human, use generic terms such as a job title, like systems administrator or programmer, rather than an arbitrary name like "John" or "Jane". Use the pronoun "they" instead of "him" or "her".
		</para>

		<title>How to Use Pronouns</title>
		 <para>
			For pronouns to work as designed, they require two things:
		</para>
		 <orderedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The reader must know what noun the pronoun references.
				</para>

			</listitem>
			 <listitem>
				<para>
					The tense of the pronoun and its noun and verb must match.
				</para>

			</listitem>

		</orderedlist>
		 <para>
			Here are some examples:
		</para>
		 <bridgehead>Singular noun</bridgehead> <informalexample> <para>
			When referring back to a singular noun, use the pronoun <emphasis>it</emphasis>. For example:
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <informalexample> <para>
			The server is running RHEL&nbsp;7, and it has 8&nbsp;TB of storage.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <bridgehead>Plural pronouns</bridgehead> <para>
			When referring back to a plural noun, use the pronoun <emphasis>they</emphasis>. For example:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Desktop computers often get used for office tasks, but they can also be configured as servers.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <bridgehead>Possessive pronouns</bridgehead> <para>
			To indicate that a pronoun possesses something, use the possessive form of the appropriate pronoun. For example:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Emacs is a text editor, but its real power is its LISP interpreter.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			The same applies for plural forms:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Open source programmers are brave to subject their code to the scrutiny of anyone who wants to look at it.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			You may have both singular and plural in a sentence:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Your colleagues may run Windows or MacOS on their computers, but you should run Linux on yours.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <bridgehead>Pronouns in context</bridgehead> <para>
			Sometimes a pronoun is used in a separate sentence than the one establishing the noun being referenced. This relies on the reader to understand from context which noun the pronoun most likely refers to.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Sometimes it is very obvious:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			I like drinking coffee while I sit and type at my computer. Sometimes, I even dunk a doughnut into it.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			In that phrase, the reader knows what "it" means from contextual clues. The writer means "Sometimes, I dunk a doughnut into my coffee", not "Sometimes, I dunk a doughnut into my computer."
		</para>
		 <para>
			Sometimes it is less obvious:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			The <command>foo</command> command is being developed to replace the <command>bar</command> command. It is installed by default, and it has a bug in it that erases all of your data permanently.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			In that paragraph, the reader cannot know definitively which command, <command>foo</command> or <command>bar</command>, erases all of their data and which command is safe to use. Sometimes, using a pronoun is not as effective as being explicit.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Try rewriting the sample paragraph, assuming that <command>foo</command> is the dangerous command and that <command>bar</command> is the safe command.
		</para>
		 <bridgehead>Verifying pronouns</bridgehead> <para>
			To verify that a pronoun makes sense, reread a sentence or paragraph, replacing the pronoun you chose with the subject: For example:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Desktop computers often get used for office tasks, but they can also be configured as servers for a small network.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Desktop computers often get used for office tasks, but desktop computers can also be configured as servers for a small network.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			If it does not make sense, or if it impossible to read back with its subject replaced because there is no indication of what the correct subject is, then the pronoun has not been used correctly.
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			The <command>foo</command> command is being developed to replace the <command>bar</command> command. It is installed by default, and it has a bug in it that erases all of your data permanently.
		</para>
		 <para>
			The <command>foo</command> command is being developed to replace the <command>bar</command> command. <emphasis>Foo? Bar?</emphasis> is installed by default, and <emphasis>foo? bar?</emphasis> has a bug in <emphasis>foo? bar?</emphasis> that erases all of your data permanently.
		</para>
		 </informalexample> <para>
			If it still says what you meant to say, then you have placed the pronoun in the correct place. Here is an example using a plural pronoun:
		</para>
		 <informalexample> <para>
			Pronouns are like variables. They hold whatever information the author places into them.
		</para>
		 <para>
			Pronouns are like variables. Pronouns and variables hold whatever information the author places into pronouns and variables.
		</para>
		 </informalexample>
