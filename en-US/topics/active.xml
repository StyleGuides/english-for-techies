    Writing in Active Voice
  </title>

  <para>
    Writing in the <firstterm>active voice</firstterm> creates
    powerful and engaging content. The active voice suggests that the
    written word is &#34;speaking&#34; directly to the reader,
    enabling the reader to learn quickly, and to take action when an
    exercise requires it. For technical writing, the active voice is
    the clearest way to demonstrate action and result, or cause and
    effect.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Active voice</bridgehead>

  <para>
    In the active voice, the subject of the sentence is also
    the person or thing performing an action.
  </para>

  <informalexample>
    <para>
      I compiled the code.
    </para>
  </informalexample>
  

  <bridgehead>Passive voice</bridgehead>

  <para>
    The <firstterm>passive voice</firstterm> is the opposite of active
    voice. In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence is the
    person or thing receiving action:
  </para>

  <informalexample>
    <para>
      The code was compiled by me.
    </para>
  </informalexample>
  
  <para>
    While the passive voice is not grammatically incorrect, it is less
    efficient than the active voice and also tends to cause confusion
    about who is doing what.
  </para>

  <para>
    Here is another sentence in the passive voice&#58;
  </para>

  <informalexample>
    <para>
      A key being pressed prompts the computer to continue.
    </para>
  </informalexample>

  <para>
    Is this sentence an instruction tellying you to press a key, or is
    it just a footnote about what happens when a key is pressed?
  </para>

  <para>
    The active voice is both clearer and more concise&#58;
  </para>

 <informalexample>
    <para>
      Press any key to continue.
  </para>  
 </informalexample>

    <title>Writing in the active voice</title>

    <para>
      To use the active voice, write as if you're composing a list of
      instructions for your reader. You are not writing a description
      of what the reader <emphasis>would see</emphasis> if the reader
      <emphasis>were sitting</emphasis> in front of your computer,
      seeing what you see as you write. The reader is seeing what is
      on the reader's own computer screen, and they are doing what you
      tell them to do.
    </para>

    <para>
      Here are some examples of sentences written in the passive
      voice, and how to rewrite them in the active voice&#58;
